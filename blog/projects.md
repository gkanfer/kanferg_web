The [AI Powered Photoswitchable Genetic CRISPR Screen, Version 2 (AIPyS)](https://github.com/GilKanfer/AIPyS) project represents a significant leap in applying parametric object detection in genomic research. By employing advanced deep learning models like U-net and cGAN within this initiative, I've facilitated object detection and the segmenting of genomic elements more precisely and efficiently. This project has been pivotal in accelerating functional genomic discoveries.

In the [AI-Powered Photoswitchable Genetic CRISPR Screen, Version 1 (AIPSr)](https://github.com/GilKanfer/AIPSr), I developed a neural network-based cell classifier using Keras/TensorFlow. This project integrated deep learning techniques to revolutionize cell classification methods, enhancing the accuracy of genomic screenings significantly. Our deployment program integrated this platform with screening microscopes, pushing the frontiers of automated genomic analyses.

I have developed an [Automated Pipeline for Genomic Data Analysis](https://github.com/GilKanfer/GenomicAnalysisTool), which streamlines the processing of transcriptomic data, particularly focusing on Parkinson's disease research. This tool employs EdgeR and GSEA, integrated with Cystoscope for visual analytics, providing a comprehensive platform for functional enrichment analysis. This pipeline showcases my commitment to advancing biomedical research through the creation of highly efficient, automated analysis tools.

The project on [Characterizing Protein-Protein Interactions](https://github.com/GilKanfer/ProteinInteractionStudy) involves in-depth proteomic analyses to understand the dynamics of protein interaction networks in dividing cells. Utilizing affinity purification coupled with SILAC, this research offers insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating cell division and highlights potential therapeutic targets for cellular dysfunction diseases. The application of this knowledge spans numerous fields, including cancer research and neurodegenerative disease studies.
